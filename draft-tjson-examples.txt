#
# [DRAFT] Annotated TJSON examples intended for testing TJSON parsers
#
# Revision: 20 (bump this when making changes to this file)
#
# Syntax used in this file:
#
# - Any line beginning with a '#' is a comment and should be ignored
# - Examples are delimited by a line containing only '-----' (5 hyphen characters)
# - This file should begin/end with '-----' with only comments allowed before/after
#   the leading and trailing '-----' respectively (i.e. this comment block)
# - Each example consists of TOML metadata and an example, separated by a blank line
#
# Example metadata syntax:
#
# - name = "Name of this example"
# - description = "A more extended description of what this example tests"
# - result = "success" | "error"
#
